This number is not always present on the immigrant petition, and name/date of birth matching is not as reliable. The goal of I-485 Family Matching is to leverage AI to more confidently create connections between petitioners and their families based on limited data.

Additionally, it will be able to help identify and group I485s filed by family members, as well as gather up the many ancillary forms they may have pending (such as I765, I131). Similar to immigrant petition matching, it can be difficult to match up I485s filed by family members. In these cases the only similar fields are a common address.

and X-ray Free-electron Laser Sources. When these diffract from a 
crystal containing defects, interference leads to the formation of a 
modulated diffraction pattern called """"speckle"""". When the defects move 
around, they can be quantified by a correlation analysis technique called 
X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy. But the speckles also change 
when the beam moves on the sample. By scanning the beam in a 
controlled way, the overlap between the adjacent regions gives 
redundancy to the data, which allows a solution of the inherent phase 
problem. This is the basis of the coherent X-ray ptychography method 
which can achieve image resolutions of 10nm, but only if the probe 
positions are known.
The goal of this proposal will be to separate """"genuine"""" fluctuations of a 
material sample from the inherent beam fluctuations at the high data 
rates of XFELs. Algorithms will be developed to calculate the 
correlations between all the coherent diffraction patterns arriving in a 
time series, then used to separate the two sources of fluctuation using

The balanced accuracies of these source-based exposure pathway models range from 73 to 81%, with the error rate for identifying positive chemicals ranging from 17 to 36%. We then used exposure pathways to organize predictions from 13 different exposure models as well as other predictors of human intake rates. We created a consensus, meta-model using the Systematic Empirical Evaluation of Models framework in which the predictors of exposure were combined by pathway and weighted according to predictive ability for chemical intake rates inferred from human biomonitoring data for 114 chemicals. The consensus model yields an R2 of ∼0.8. We extrapolate to predict relevant pathway(s), median intake rate, and credible interval for 479 926 chemicals, mostly with minimal exposure information. This approach identifies 1880 chemicals for which the median population intake rates may exceed 0.1 mg/kg bodyweight/day, while there is 95% confidence that the median intake rate is below 1 μg/kg BW/day for 474572 compounds.

Automatic speech recognition has been widely used in many applications. Its cutting-edge technology is transformer-based sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model, which is trained to generate transcripts autoregressively and has been fine-tuned on certain datasets. Using pre-trained language models directly may not be suitable because they might not work properly with different accents and specialized regulatory and scientific terminologies. This is because the models were trained on a specific type of data and may not be able to handle data that is significantly different from what they were trained on. To address this, researchers plan to manually read a set of video/audio to obtain their true transcripts, upon which they fine-tune the model to make it adapt to this new domain. Machine translation converts a sequence of text from one language to another. Researchers usually use a method called ""seq2seq,"" where original text is codified into a language that a computer can understand. Then, we use this code to generate the translated version of the text. It's like a translator who listens to someone speak in one language and then repeats what they said in another language. Similarly, it is not appropriate to directly apply the existing pre-trained seq2seq models, because (a) some languages used in the FDA context might not exist in existing models. (b) domain specific terms used in FDA are very different from general human languages. To tackle these challenges, models are trained for some unusual languages and fine-tune pre-trained models for major languages. For both situations, researchers prepare high-quality training set labeled by experts. University of Maryland CERSI (M-CERSI) plans to build a system to manage different documents and evidence, by implementing three sub-systems: (a) document classifier, (b) video/audio classifier, and (c) an interactive middleware that connects the trained model at the backend and the input at the frontend.

The SCDM is an organizing CDM that preserves the original information from a data source and has been successfully used in the Sentinel system for over a decade. While originally built for claims data, SCDM was expanded in 2015 to accommodate some information commonly found in EHRs in separate clinical data tables to capture laboratory test results of interest and vital signs. We selected the SCDM over other CDMs because data formatted in the SCDM enables analyses that can leverage the standardized active risk identification and analysis (ARIA) tools. Operationally, both Data Partners will share SCDM transformed patient-level linked EHR-claims data with the IC after quality assessments are passed. This is a substantial advantage in this early stage of understanding how to optimally analyze such data. It will allow Sentinel investigators to directly work with the data, adapt existing analytic programs, and test algorithms. In sum, transformation of structured data from the proposed sources to SCDM format will be a key first step for potential future incorporation of these Data Partners into Sentinel to provide access to EHR-claims linked data for >10 million patients, which will be critical to meet the need identified in the 5-year Sentinel System strategic plan of 2019.",Initiation,,,Department of Health and Human Services,"[ 0.01507629 -0.02121476  0.07215529 ...  0.02455389 -0.00207597

Among these, the toxicological response is the most challenging task due to its immense complexity involving multiple pathways and protein targets. Although many adverse drug reactions (ADRs) result from genetic polymorphisms and factors such as the patient's medical history and the treatment dosage and regimen, on a fundamental level all ADRs are initiated by the binding of a drug molecule to a target, whether intended (therapeutic target) or non-intended (off-target interactions with promiscuous proteins) [7]. While molecular similarity approaches designed to identify off-target interaction sites have been explored since the late 2000s [8, 9], most have been focused on drug design, repurposing and more generally, efficacy, whereas relatively few have been applied to toxicology [10, 11].
Since there are multiple approaches to molecular similarity (structural, functional, whole molecule, pharmacophore, etc. [12]), the performance of any of the above applications depends strongly on the metrics by which similarity is quantified. For the past 10 years, DSB has been working on creating a universal molecular modeling approach utilizing unique three-dimensional fingerprints encoding both the steric and electrostatic fields governing the interactions between ligands and receptors. It has been demonstrated that these fingerprints could quantify reliably both the structural and functional similarities between molecules [13, 14] and their application for prediction of adverse events from AI generated drug - endogenous ligand - target networks could provide new insights into yet unknown mechanisms of toxicity.",Initiation,,,Department of Health and Human Services,"[-0.03245848  0.00065072  0.04162117 ...  0.01986921 -0.01975625

The ability to predict placental permeability of chemicals during pregnancy is an important factor that can inform regulatory decisions related to fetal safety and clinical trials with women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP). The human placenta contains transport proteins, which facilitate the transfer of various endogenous substances and xenobiotics. Several mechanisms allow this transfer: i) passive diffusion, ii) active transport, iii) facilitated diffusion, iv) pinocytosis, and v) phagocytosis. Among these, passive and active transport are the two major routes. Small, non-ionized, highly lipophilic drugs cross the placenta via passive diffusion; however, relatively large molecules (MW > 500 Da) with low lipophilicity are carried by transporters. While prediction of the ability of drugs to cross the placenta via diffusion is straight-forward, the complexity of molecular interactions between drugs and transporters has proven to be a challenging problem to solve. Virtually, all QSARs (Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships) published to date model small datasets (usually not exceeding 100 drugs) and utilize weak validation strategies [1-5].
In this proposal, 3D-molecular similarities of endogenous placental transporter ligands to known drug substrates will be used to identify the most likely mode of drug transportation (active/passive) and build predictive, quantitative and categorical 3D-SDAR models by linking their molecular characteristics to placental permeability. Permeability data will be collected via mining the literature, the CDER databases, and conducting empirical assessments using in vitro NAMs with confirmation using rodent models.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) often starts with use of prescription opioid analgesics. Therefore, the development of abuse-deterrent analgesic products may significantly impact the trajectory of the opioid crisis. In addition, FDA is making new efforts to support novel product innovation for pain management and the treatment of OUD to combat this opioid crisis. 
Opioid agonists bind and activate opioid receptors to decrease calcium influx and  cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), leading to hyperpolarization that inhibits pain transmission. Opioid antagonists bind and inhibit or block opioid receptors. Both opioid agonists and antagonists are used in drug products for pain management and treatment of opioid addiction. An opioid agonists/antagonists knowledgebase (OAK) would be useful for FDA reviewers to inform evaluation and to assist development of analgesics and of additional treatments for OUD.
To create a comprehensive OAK, we propose to curate the experimental data on opioid agonist/antagonist activity from the public domain, experimentally test some 2800 drugs in functional opioid receptor assays using quantitative high-throughput screen (qHTS) platform, and develop and validate in silico models to predict opioid agonist/antagonist activity.

For chemicals without experimental data, read-across methods could be used to find similar chemicals in OAK to estimate the opioid agonist/antagonist activity, and the in silico models in OAK could be used to predict the opioid agonist/antagonist activity.

AR is the target for many drugs but it could also act as an off target for drugs and other chemicals. Therefore, detecting androgenic activity of drugs and other FDA regulated chemicals is critical for evaluation of drug safety and assessment of chemical risk. There is a large amount of androgenic activity data in the public domain, which could be an asset for the scientific community and regulatory science. However, the data are distributed across different and diverse sources and stored in different formats, limiting the use of the data in research and regulation. Therefore, a comprehensive, reliable resource to provide open access to the data and enable modeling and prediction of androgenic activity for untested chemicals is in urgent need. This project will develop a high-quality open access Molecules with Androgenic Activity Resource (MAAR) including data and predictive models fully compliant with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles.  MAAR can be used to facilitate research on androgenic activity of chemicals and support regulatory decision making concerning efficacy and safety evaluation of drugs and chemicals in the FDA regulated products.",Implementation,,,Department of Health and Human Services,"[-0.00026646  0.03862183 -0.01237428 ... -0.00074874 -0.04437505

Therefore, analysis of semantic relationships plays a vital role to extract useful information from the FDA documents to facilitate the regulatory science research and improve FDA product review process. The rapid advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) for Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers an unprecedent opportunity to analyze the semantic text data by using the language models that are trained with large biomedical corpus. This study is to assess the AI based NLP for the FDA documents with a focus on the FDA labeling documents. Specifically, we will apply the publicly available language models (e.g., BERT and BioBERT) to the FDA drug labeling documents available from the FDA Label tool that manages over 120K labeling documents including over 40K Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products. We will investigate three areas of AI applications that are important to the regulatory science research: (1) the interpretation and classification of drug properties (e.g., safety and efficacy) with AI reading, (2) text summarization to provide highlights of labeling sections, (3) automatic anomaly analysis (AAA) for signal identification, and (4) information retrieval with Amazon-like Questions/Answer. We will compare the AI based NLP with MedDRA based approach whenever possible for drug safety and efficacy. The study will provide a benchmark for fit-for-purpose application of the public language models to the FDA documents and, moreover, the outcome of the study could provide a scientific basis to support the future development of FDALabel tool which is widely used in CDER review process.",Implementation,,,Department of Health and Human Services,"[-0.04869485  0.01115427 -0.00663533 ...  0.02832982  0.00045234

Currently, no vaccines and/or drugs have been proved to be effective to treat COVID-19. Therefore, many drug products on the market are being repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19. However, sufficient evidence is needed to determine that the repurposed drugs are safe and effective. Therefore, safety information on the drugs  selected for repurposing purpose is important. The proposed project aims to mine adverse drug events using artificial intelligence and big data analytics in the public domain including the agency's database, public databases, and social media data for the drugs to be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide detailed adverse event information that can be used to facilitate safety evaluation for drugs repurposed for the treatment COVID-19.

494,HHS-0105-2023,HHS,FDA,NCTR,Towards Explainable AI: Advancing Predictive Modeling for Regulatory Use,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad discipline of training machines to think and accomplish complex intellectual tasks like humans. It learns from existing data/information to predict future outcomes, distill knowledge, offer advices, or plan action steps. The rise of AI has offered both opportunities and challenges to FDA in two aspects: (1) how to assess and evaluate marketed AI-centric products and (2) how to implement AI methods to improve the agency's operation. One of the key aspects of both regulatory applications is to understand the underlying features driving the AI performance and to the extension of its interpretability in the context of application.  
 
Different from the statistical evaluation (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity and specificity), model interpretability assessment lacks quantitative metrics. In most cases, the assessment tends to be subjective, where prior knowledge is often used as a ground-truth to explain the biological relevance of underlying features, e.g., whether the biomarkers featured by the model are in accordance with the existing findings. In reality, there is a trade-off between statistical performance and interpretability among different AI algorithms, and understanding the difference will improve the context of use of AI technologies in regulatory science.  

For that, we will investigate representative AI methods, in terms of their performance and interpretability, first through benchmark datasets that have been well-established in the research community, then extended to clinical/pre-clinical datasets. This project will provide basic parameters and offer an insightful guidance on developing explainable AI models to facilitate the real-world decision making in regulatory settings.",Implementation,,,Department of Health and Human Services,"[-0.03333654 -0.01922615 -0.00208353 ...  0.00936089 -0.0047495

POU can potentially cause various adverse effects in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, immune, endocrine, and central nervous systems. Important sex differences have been observed in POU-associated cardiac endpoints. Currently, systematic knowledge is lacking for risk factors associated with the increased cardiotoxicity of POU in women. 2) Currently, the FDA utilizes two methods of analysis for data mining, the Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) and the Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) to identify significant statistical associations between products and adverse events (AEs). These methods are not applicable when two or more reporting measures (e.g. gender, age, race, etc.) must be considered and compared. In this study, a novel statistical model will be developed to detect the safety signals when gender is considered as the third variable. Safety signals will then be detected and compared from combined multiple-layered real-world evidence in the form of EHRs from diverse sources. Sex-dependent differences in risk factors for cardiotoxicity from POU will be identified and analyzed using big data methods and AI-related tools. 3) The proposed project addresses the first of four priority areas of FDA's 2018 Strategic Policy Roadmap: Reduce the burden of addiction crises that are threatening American families, and two priority areas of Women's Health Research Roadmap: Priority Area 1: Advance Safety and Efficacy, and Priority Area 5: Expand Data Sources and Analysis.

AI is a computer system or algorithm that has the ability to learn from existing data to foresee the future outcome. ML, a subset of AI, has been specifically studied to make predictions for adverse drug reactions. Deep Learning (DL) is arguably the most advanced approach in ML which frequently outperforms other types of ML approaches (or conventional ML approaches) for the study of drug safety and efficacy. DL usually consists of multiple layers of neural networks to mimic the cognitive behaviors associated with the human brain learning and problem-solving process to solve data intensive problems.

This technique allows for the ""finding"" of discovery to be a document.  Our customers can search for and discover all their RFPs, purchase orders, NDAs, financial statements, budget documents, resumes, etc.  In cases where NARA has a document type in mind that vendor’s COTS solution does not already understand, we should be able to assemble a learning set of documents (typically 20 - 100 examples) and train the vendor algorithm to find all documents of that type.",Initiation,"Document/File Classification: Document/file classification is a supervised ML algorithm that classifies whole documents according to their type.

Semantic search can solve this problem by allowing users to search the catalog using natural language queries. Semantic search is a data searching technique that not only finds the matching keywords based on user search terms but also understands the user’s intent and contextual meaning behind the search terms. Semantic search can also help to improve the accuracy and relevance of search results. By analyzing the meaning and context of search queries, semantic search can provide more accurate and relevant results than traditional keyword-based search methods. This can help researchers and historians to find the records and documents they need more quickly and easily.

Additionally, semantic search can help to identify the relationships between records and documents in the NARA catalog.

Reservoirs are particularly susceptible to the negative impacts of land-use and land-cover (LULC) activities and runoff because of their complex dynamics, relatively longer water residence times, and their role as an integrating sink for pollutants from their drainage basins. Despite these interrelationships and significance in regional and global economic stability, land and water (L-W) are often treated in “silos”. To understand the complex L-W nexus within the LRB, this study will use data-driven artificial intelligence for quantitative determination of the relationships between LULC change, together with socioeconomic development indicators and climate change, and their impacts on water quality and availability within the basin, both for 1984-2019 and to predict future scenarios (2020-2050). To advance data acquisition for LULC analysis and climate change, the study utilizes optical Earth-observation and meteorological satellite data. To provide near real-time and cost-effective approach for continuous monitoring of reservoir water quality within the basin, the study will develop empirical models for water quality estimation and water quality index mapping using 35-years of in-situ water quality measurements and water spectral observations using drone-borne spectrometer and optical satellite imagery through regression modeling and geospatial methods.",Development and Acquisition,,,U.S. Agency for International Development,[0.00191134 0.05291273 0.06615364 ... 0.0105609  0.03152356 0.02732212],1,"[('botswana', 0.3095), ('climate', 0.3082), ('drainage', 0.2972), ('basin', 0.2936), ('runoff', 0.2824)]"

There are young people in the area who have studied information technologies and allied sciences, and while most of them can write computer programs, they cannot solve machine vision problems. This project aims to increase awareness among the youth of Morogoro and nearby regions to address machine vision problems in agriculture. Machine vision is a new and understudied practice in Tanzania; hence, this project will contribute to efforts in the creation of scientific societies that address the most pressing problems faced by more than 80% of Tanzania’s population who engage in farming. The main agricultural problems can be classified into five categories, as explained below: (1) Disease Detection and Classification: The project will develop experts who will solve problems in disease identification using machine vision for most of the diseases in crops and livestock, which are misdiagnosed by farmers. (2) Weed Classification: The project will develop algorithms that accurately identify weeds and contribute to the growing scientific database for automatic weed detection. (3) Pest Detection and Classification: Appropriate tools using machine vision for Integrated Pest Management (IPM) are needed in Tanzania, as IPM has been hindered due to a lack of extension officers to train farmers on mitigation and identification of pests in agriculture. (4) Crop Seedlings Stand Count and Yield Estimation: Use of machine vision and drones instead of scouting manually to estimate stand counts would provide appropriate mitigation strategies for replanting that would be beneficial to commercial farmers. Also of importance are algorithms to sort and estimate yield by counting the fruits and to estimate the amount of other agricultural products. (5) Crop Vigor Estimation: Most farmers apply inputs evenly across the farm because they cannot predetermine crop vigor. Accurate estimation of crop health would help farmers to mitigate the problems earlier and improve crop performance and avoid failure.
